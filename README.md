# Book Search Engine Refactor

## Description
As an avid reader, I want to search for new books to read so that I can keep a list of books to purchase.Through this MERN challenge, I was able to apply and improve upon my skills of using middlewae to work with the GraphQL API. I became more familiar with the Apollo Server and became more confident in my abilities to define queries and mutations.
